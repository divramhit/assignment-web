  <p>Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are not wanting at Chicago.  Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other, and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway left at full speed, as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose.  It traversed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey like a flash, rushing through towns with antique names, some of which had streets and car-tracks, but as yet no houses.  At last the Hudson came into view; and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th, the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river, before the very pier of the Cunard line.</p>

  <p>The China, for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour before!</p>

  <p>The China, in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg's last hope.  None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects.  The Pereire, of the French Transatlantic Company, whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort, did not leave until the 14th; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London, but to Havre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg's last efforts of no avail.  The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw, which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers.</p>
